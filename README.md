![Demo gif](/passwd_predict_demo.gif?raw=true "Demo GIF")

HOW TO RUN:

1. Download predict_passwd.jar file.

2. I have not inserted rockyou-withcount.txt in this jar due to huge size.

3. Import the jar file in Eclipse

4. Download http://downloads.skullsecurity.org/passwords/rockyou-withcount.txt.bz2 and extract rockyou-withcount.txt

5. Please copy rockyou-withcount.txt in the same folder which has the Passwd.java file.

6. After that, open Passwd.java and click Run.

7. After the application loads, please wait for the "Loading rockyou-withcount.txt. Please wait..." to disappear.

8. If you don't get the message: "rockyou-withcount.txt is not present in root directory of project" on top of the application,
   it means you've copied the rockyou-withcount.txt file right.
